# How to compile and execute my connect four code.

## Author
Dimitri Jones

## Motivation
I am doing this project for an assignment for my CS 480 class.

## Build Status
My project at the moment compiles and runs. The AI will play against you at a medium level. Sometimes the AI does not realize that it needs to place the chip in a particular spot to win at that moment. This usally happens after the board is mostly full.

## Code Style
This project is written in Python 3.10

## Tech/Framework used
I have written this program in PyCharm 2021.3. This whole project was written in Python.

## How to Use?
For this program/game there are two players. Player 1 whom is you and player 2 whom is the AI. Either you or the AI will go first. It is randomized for who goes first. The players will take turns placing there chips in each column until a player wins.

## Solution
This is the solution and outcome of a game.
